# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U).
I know, I'm not suppose to add Sass folder in my repository, since it wouldn't be processed on the actual website page. but I included it just to share what I actually code for the styling for the web page. Thank you.
